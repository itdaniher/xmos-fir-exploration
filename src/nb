Calling FIR
-----------
  
The function that performs the run time fir is in module_fir. Inlcude the 
file fir.h and call::  
  
  filteredSample = fir(sampleValue, coefficientTable, stateTable, N)
  
sampleValue should be a 8.24 fixed point number, and the function returns 
the filtered 8.24 value. CoefficientTable is the name of the array that
was produced by the code above, stateTable should be an array of N integers  
which is initialised to all zeroes prior to the first call to fir, and N is  
the number of taps (the -n parameter above). The stateTable will contain  
N old samples.
